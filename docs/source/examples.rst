Examples
========

This section provides complete modelling examples to demonstrate the
capabilities of ``gurobipy-pandas``. The examples are intentionally kept
small so that they can be solved using the
:doc:`gurobipy trial license<license>`.

If you would like to run the examples as Jupyter notebooks yourself, you can
:download:`download all examples and data </artifact/gurobipy-pandas-examples.zip>`
as a zip archive. You will need a local Jupyter environment to view and run
the notebooks.
