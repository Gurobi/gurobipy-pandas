Examples
========

This section provides complete modelling examples to demonstrate the capabilities of ``gurobipy-pandas``. Each one is displayed as a jupyter notebook, and the necessary data to run the code is available :ghsrc:`on Github <docs/source/examples/data>`. The examples are intentionally kept small so that they can be solved using the :doc:`gurobipy trial license<license>`.
