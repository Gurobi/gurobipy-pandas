Examples
========

This section provides complete modelling examples to demonstrate the capabilities of ``gurobipy-pandas``. The examples are intentionally kept small so that they can be solved using the :doc:`gurobipy trial license<license>`.

All example notebooks and input data files are available :ghsrc:`on Github <docs/source/examples>`. The notebooks are stored in MyST markdown format. To run them in a Jupyter environment, you will need to install `Jupytext <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
