Adding Specialized Constraints
==============================

``gurobipy-pandas`` helper methods currently only cover building linear and quadratic constraints, i.e. those which can be expressed using pandas' built-in arithmetic, groupby, and aggregation methods. In some cases you may need to build other constraint types, such as SOS or general constraints, between different series of variables. This page provides some simple recipes for such operations.

SOS Constraints
---------------

In this example, we wish to build the constraint set :math:`\text{SOS1}(x_i, y_i)` for each :math:`i` in the index.

.. doctest:: [advanced]

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import gurobipy as gp
    >>> from gurobipy import GRB
    >>> import gurobipy_pandas as gppd
    >>> gppd.set_interactive()

    >>> m = gp.Model()
    >>> index = pd.RangeIndex(5)
    >>> x = gppd.add_vars(m, index, name="x")
    >>> y = gppd.add_vars(m, index, name="y")

There is no built-in ``gurobipy-pandas`` method for this, so we need to first align our variable series in a dataframe, then iterate over the rows in the result. To iterate over rows efficiently, we use ``.itertuples()``, and call the ``addSOS`` function on the Gurobi model.

.. doctest:: [advanced]

    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({"x": x, "y": y})
    >>> df
                       x                  y
    0  <gurobi.Var x[0]>  <gurobi.Var y[0]>
    1  <gurobi.Var x[1]>  <gurobi.Var y[1]>
    2  <gurobi.Var x[2]>  <gurobi.Var y[2]>
    3  <gurobi.Var x[3]>  <gurobi.Var y[3]>
    4  <gurobi.Var x[4]>  <gurobi.Var y[4]>
    >>> cs = []
    >>> for row in df.itertuples(index=False):
    ...     c = m.addSOS(GRB.SOS_TYPE1, [row.x, row.y])
    ...     cs.append(c)
    >>> sos = pd.Series(index=df.index, data=cs, name="sos")

The resulting ``sos`` series captures the resulting SOS constraint objects.
