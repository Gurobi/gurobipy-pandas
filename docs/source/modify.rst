Modifying Models
================

TODO

- Modifying the RHS of constraints (using Gurobi attributes)
  - Mention gotchas around how the sense & RHS are defined
- Modifying variable bounds
  - Note that it's best to include any necessary bounds from the beginning
- Fixing variables (testing scenarios)
- Adding constraints (this is no different after solving a model)
- Modifying coefficients
- Note that in some cases, just writing your model as a parameterised
  function is a cleaner/better approach
