Inspecting Models
=================

TODO

- Show some examples of inspecting vars and constraints in interactive
  mode (for sanity checks).
- Note that this doesn't replace proper testing for production-level
  code. But it is a useful tool when developing to check that a given
  pandas operation produces the constraints you expect.
